Parse XML-based Shakespeare script to assign multiple roles without any overlap

This is a simple page for groups that want to read a Shakespeare play, but need to assign more than one role to each person. The script tries to determine the optimal assignment of roles so that (1) no reader will ever have to read two lines in a row by different characters and (2) each reader will get roughly the same number of lines. Because the resulting breakdown may not match every group's preferences, the page includes the ability to sort the readers in any way you choose.

### New Features (June 2015)

The sort page now includes the entire text of the play, with the names of each reader added to each character's name.
